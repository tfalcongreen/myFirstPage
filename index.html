        Background : I'm 25, from Brisbane, Australia. I'm using this course to further my education within the IT industry.
   <h2 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;"><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h2>
      <p style="background-color:Tomato;">
           • What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular
            event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

            My interests in IT go back to some of my earliest memories at home. I remember our old dial-up connection beeping away 
            taking so long to produce even an image. Limewire and Torrents came next, accidently downloading viruses onto the family 
            computer while only trying to get a few songs on my 512mb mp3 player. While going to the local Trash & Treasure I would 
            often find old computers to take apart and see the insides, taking out the fans to connect to 9v batteries was always exciting.
            Later in life I found an interest in Graphic design, Sound engineering and small bits of coding through internet courses. The
            Graphic design was a creative outlet for me, as my pen to paper art skills are sub-par at best. Through an interest in live sound
            I continued to focus on the hardware element of IT, connecting technology and music, two of my loves. I began to delve into the
            world of coding, which brought me to this course.

          • Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
            I chose RMIT as Melbourne is one of my favourite cities in all of Australia. The hope is once my Bachelor's commences I will do a
            semester on campus in the city. RMIT was offered through OUA I will be able to study in a more flexible way compared to being 100%
            on campus.

          • What do you expect to learn during your studies?
            I aim to learn more about the wide world of IT during my studies, eventually positioning myself in such a way as to gain employment
            within the industry. I hope to find my place within the broad world that IT is.
