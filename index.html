<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>
  • What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular
    event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
    
    My interests in IT go back to some of my earliest memories at home. I remember our old dial-up connection beeping away 
    taking so long to produce even an image. Limewire and Torrents came next, accidently downloading viruses onto the family 
    computer while only trying to get a few songs on my 512mb mp3 player. While going to the local Trash & Treasure I would 
    often find old computers to take apart and see the insides, taking out the fans to connect to 9v batteries was always exciting.
    Later in life I found an interest in Graphic design, Sound engineering and small bits of coding through internet courses. The
    Graphic design was a creative outlet for me, as my pen to paper art skills are sub-par at best. Through an interest in live sound
    I continued to focus on the hardware element of IT, connecting technology and music, two of my loves. I began to delve into the
    world of coding, which brought me to this course.
